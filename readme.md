# Project Description
This is a basic project using Java to simply implement a better LinkedList that reduces issues caused from Random Access. Random access moves from O(n) to guaranteed less than 10 iterations, but this will be a customisable implementation where the user is able to adjust the indexing.

I made this primarily for a University Project where a LinkedList was the best Java Collection to use but indexing easily was not possible. By being able to customise my implementation to make it more efficient for my use, I hope others may also find usefulness in this.

Currently, this only implements the List<E> functionality, however down the line I would like to further implement both Queue<> and Stack<> functionality as the ADT LinkedList does.

I would like to note that this project will not contain any build tools, and will simply be a playground for the code to exist within.

### The reason for missing early commits
All early commits were completed during my University Project on a Private GitLab repository and no, I will not share.
